# AEROMIT_CADS

#Overview  
This repository showcases my CAD designs created as part of my work in AEROMIT at Manipal Institute of Technology. These models highlight my expertise in 3D modelling, UAV design and structural/aerodynamic analysis. The repository is intended to support my application.

#Contents  
This repository includes :

1. VTOL UAV Design - A concept design rotating front propellers capable of vertical take off and landing  
2. Ducted fan Design - A blended wing body integrated with a ducted fan system designed for quite and efficient operations  
3. Circuit Assembly - A detailed circuit layout demonstrating my CAD proficiency  
4. CFD Simulation - A CFD simulation and analysis of a concept design for research purposes  
5. FEA Analysis - A Finite Element Analysis (structural simulation) of a UAV design to evaluate stress and deformation  


#Software Used  
1. SolidWorks - For 3D modelling and assembly  
2. ANSYS - For structural and aerodynamic Analysis  

#How to View the Models  
1. Download the .SLDPRT and .SLDASM files   
2. Open them in SolidWorks to view the models
3. For FEA and CFD simulations, open ANSYS Workbench and load the .ANSYS files  
4. Navigate to the Solution module to review results  
5. If you donâ€™t have ANSYS, check screenshots for key findings.

# Confidentiality Notice  
Due to publication restrictions and confidentiality agreements, I am unable to upload the CAD models, FEA, and CFD simulation files from my research projects at this time. However, relevant details have been included in my resume.
