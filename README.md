# AEROMIT_CADS

#Overview  
This repository showcases my CAD designs created as part of my work in AEROMIT at Manipal Institute of Technology. These models highlight my expertise in modelling, including UAV components and designs. The repository is intended to support my application for a Aircframe Service Engineering Intern at Boeing.

#Contents
This repository includes :

#1. VTOL UAV Design - A concept design rotating front propellers capable of vertical take off and landing
#2. Ducted fan Design - A blended wing body incorporated with a ducted fan system designed for quite and smooth operations
#3. Circuit Assembly - A detailed circuit layout to showcase my modelling proficiency
#4. 


#Software Used
#1. SolidWorks
#2. Ansys (for structural and CFD Analysis)

#How to View the Models
#1. Download the .STEP and 
#2. Open them in SolidWorks
#3. For FEA simulations, open ANSYS Workbench and load the .ANSYS files
34. Navigate to the Solution module to review results
#5. If you donâ€™t have ANSYS, check screenshots for key findings.
